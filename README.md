# Step-wise-Learning


Train.py is used to train the simple feedforward network using step-wise learning approach.
- train.py might need several attempts to converge. 
- this might takes hours to converge on initial pair of data. 

angle_measurement.py is used to evaluate the performance of a network on various angles of an object.
